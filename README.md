## **Breast cancer detection**

This project aimed the detection of breast cancer using the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29).

Followed steps:
 > 1. Data cleansing
 > > - Correction missing values
 > 2. Data visualization and analysis
 > > - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data visualization
 > 3. Model selection with hyperparameters tuning
 > > - Random Forest Classifier
 > > - Support Vector Machine
 > > - Logistic Regression
 > > - Voting Classifier with the previously tuned models (following a [Kaggle Kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/yassineghouzam/titanic-top-4-with-ensemble-modeling))
 > 4. Comparison between models and final observations
 
 
Useful tools:
 > - Pandas
 > - NumPy
 > - Matplotlib and Seaborn
 > - Scikit-learn
